## Before we begin

**r cafe** is an initiative of EROS, the departmental working group for open research.


Come to our next EROS meeting: Week 8, Thurs 10 June, 2-3pm


---
## The basics
**R Cafe**    
When and where? From Week 6, Thursdays 1:00-2:00pm, online    


**What is it?**     
We are a peer support group in the Department of Education for all those interested in learning and using r. We hold weekly drop-ins to troubleshoot, learn and share resources.


**Who is it for?**    
_Everyone_ is welcome, from complete beginner to code ninja, Stage 1 undergraduate to full prof :).


**I want to get involved (but canâ€™t make it to the meeting).**     
Join our Google Group to get updates, share resources and ask questions

---
## The format

#### _Like a writing support group, but for r_


- *Writing group* - drop in and code, ask for help to troubleshoot 

#### _...and with some extras_

- *Show and tell* - code review style, come and present your code for 15 minutes + Q/A


- *Pre-determined discussion topic* - we pick a topic (e.g. keeping your directories straight, updating R, collaborating with non R users :), and share our experiences.


- **Special events (termly)** - e.g., how reproducible is your code? Buddy code swap/review, training sessions on special topic

####We need r users of *all levels* to make it work - there is no code shaming here!

#### "If you need help getting unstuck, the first step is to create a **reprex**, or reproducible example. The goal of a reprex is to package your problematic code in such a way that **other people can run it** and feel your pain. Then, hopefully, they can provide a solution and put you out of your misery."

## What is a reprex?

The term *reprex* stands for **repr**oducible **ex**ample.

If you ever ask for R help on a forum, you will be asked for example code that reproduces the problem: a *reprex*.


---


## What is in a reprex?

<br/>
A reprex should include:    
    
> - A **minimal dataset**, necessary to reproduce the issue  
> - The **minimal runnable code** necessary to reproduce the issue, which can be run
on the given dataset, and including the necessary information on the used packages  



*From the RStudio Community guide*

---
## How do I make a reproducible example?

Two packages can help:
- Datapasta
- ReprEx

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.alt = "Reprex package logo"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figs/datapasta.png", "figs/reprex.png"))
```
]
---

## A minimal dataset
Sharing huge data sets is not necessary and may rather discourage others from reading your question.

Instead you can:

- (1/3) rewrite your code to run using one of R's built-in datasets. Find them using `data()`, and explore their variables with `str()`

- (2/3) simulate data to run your code on(i.e. create a fake dataset)

- (3/3) use the `datapasta` package to provide a portion of your real data

**If sharing any real data, make sure that it's properly anonymised!**



---
### R's built-in datasets 
Find a built-in dataset (`data()`) that has similar characteristics to yours (e.g. numeric, factor). A couple examples:
```{r}
str(trees)
```
```{r}
str(chickwts)
```
 
---
### Simulate data (1/2)


Create a simple, fake dataset:
```{r}
myDataSet <- tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
myDataSet
```

---

### Simulate data (2/2)
Create a more complex, fake dataset:
.smallest[
```{r}
# Simulate 50 subjects, 20 items, & pre/posttest accuracy scores. 
# This is the control group, so specify no learning gains.
# Assume there was a .25 probably of accuracy at pretest.
library(tidyverse)

n_subjects <- 50
n_items <- 20
all_subjects<-tibble()

for (i in 1:n_subjects){
sim_test <- tibble(
  group = rep("control", n_items),
  subj_id = rep(i,n_items),#repeat the subject ID for each item
  item_id = (seq(1,n_items)),#generate an id code for each item
  pretest = rbinom(n_items, 1, 0.25),#generate responses with a bias of .25
  posttest= ifelse(pretest == "0", 0, 1)#no learning or loss on posttest
) 
all_subjects<-rbind(all_subjects,sim_test)#each time through, bind the new datapoints to the main tibble
}
```
]
---
###Get a small portion of your real data (1/2)
(A fuller tutorial on using `datapasta` from Mara Averick [here](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2018/10/reprex-with-datapasta/))
- Install the `datapasta` package

- OPTION 1: If you're working from a spreadsheet (e.g. your data is in a .csv or excel file - might even work with SPSS!)
  - open the file and select **a few** rows and copy. 
  
  - Then go to your R script, and click the `Paste as tribble` option from the DATAPASTA section of the Addins dropdown. 
  
  - You now have a mini dataframe that can you assign to an object name and use 
---
#### OPTION 1 Datapasta (continued)
Here's an example of Scottish top babynames. 

- I opened the .csv in Excel, selected the first seven rows, and copied these.

- I then came to my R script, and chose `Paste as tribble` option from the DATAPASTA section of the Addins dropdown, and assigned it to `myTibble`

```{r }
myTibble <- tibble::tribble(
    ~yr, ~sex, ~FirstForename, ~number, ~rank,
  1974L,  "B",        "David",   1794L,    1L,
  1974L,  "B",         "John",   1528L,    2L,
  1974L,  "B",         "Paul",   1260L,    3L,
  1974L,  "B",         "Mark",   1234L,    4L,
  1974L,  "B",        "James",   1202L,    5L
  )
```

---
###Get a small portion of your real data (2/2)
OPTION 2: If you're working from a dataframe or object already loaded in R, and you want to insert it into a reprex.
  - use `datapasta::dpasta()` to render your object into the same format as the result of `Paste as tribble`
  
  - Assign the new code to an object and use in your code!

Here's an example where I use `head()`to extract the first 6 rows of the built-in trees dataset, and then render with `datapasta::dpasta()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
head(trees) %>% 
  datapasta::dpasta()

# data.frame(    
#        Girth = c(8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 10.5, 10.7, 10.8),    
#       Height = c(70, 65, 63, 72, 81, 83),     
#       Volume = c(10.3, 10.3, 10.2, 16.4, 18.8, 19.7)     
# )

```

---
## Minimal Code
The next step is to put together:
1. an example of the code that is causing you troubles,
1. the libraries that you are using for that code,
1. the data from the last step.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Include library calls needed
library(ggplot2) 

# Include the sample data from the last step
mydataframe <- data.frame(
       Girth = c(8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 10.5, 10.7, 10.8),
      Height = c(70, 65, 63, 72, 81, 83),
      Volume = c(10.3, 10.3, 10.2, 16.4, 18.8, 19.7)
)

# Narrow down your code to just the problematic part.
ggplot(data = mydataframe, x = Girth, y = Height) +
  geom_point()
    
```
---
class: center, middle

In case you didn't spot the error in the last slide, I forgot to put my variables inside the aes() function, in the ggplot call.
    
---
### Minimal Code

####But how do I know what code to include?

The absolute minimum amount of code that can reproduce the problem. No extra packages, no extra data manipulation steps, etc.

>"Add one line until it breaks ..."    

>"Remove one line until it works ... then add back the broken line"

### Pulling it all together

####You've got your code, libraries data, all in a single script

Here is our example again:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Include library calls needed
library(ggplot2) 

# Include the sample data from the last step
mydataframe <- data.frame(
       Girth = c(8.3, 8.6, 8.8, 10.5, 10.7, 10.8),
      Height = c(70, 65, 63, 72, 81, 83),
      Volume = c(10.3, 10.3, 10.2, 16.4, 18.8, 19.7)
)

# Narrow down your code to just the problematic part.
ggplot(data = mydataframe, x = Girth, y = Height) +
  geom_point()

#what's your environment?   
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
---
### Pulling it all together (1/2)

####You've got your code, libraries data, all in a single script

Use the `reprex` package to check it's self-contained and then share it.
- `reprex` is installed as part of the tidyverse or you can install it by itself.

- `reprex` will check whether your reproducible example *really is* self-contained and reproducible, before you send it someone else.


- After installation, `reprex` also appears in the `Addins` drop-down menu.
---
### Pulling it all together (2/2)

####You've got your code, libraries data, all in a single script

OPTION 1: 
Select all relevant code, and copy it (`Ctrl` or `Cmd` + `C`). Run `reprex::reprex()` in the console.

OPTION 2: 
Select all relevant code, and from the drop-down `Addins` `Reprex` menu, select `Reprex selection`.

Your correctly rendered code will appear in markdown format in the Viewer window, _and_ will now be **ready on your clipboard for you to paste** in a forum post, email, or zoom chat :).

> Remember, if the code isn't self-contained, `Reprex` will throw an error!
